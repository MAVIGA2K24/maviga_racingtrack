There’s a brand-new racetrack at the Los Santos Harbor, perfect for thrilling competitions and strategic pit stops. Teams can set up their vehicles, prepare for races, and spectators can experience the action up close. To keep things organized and secure, there is only one entrance to the entire facility. This ensures a controlled environment without unnecessary traffic. For emergencies, there are four separate access points reserved exclusively for emergency vehicles, allowing for a quick response if needed. Each team can set up their own vehicle pit, providing enough space for crew members to work efficiently. Right in front of these pits, there is a designated area for pit stops, where teams can change tires, refuel, or make quick repairs during the race. Spectators are well taken care of, too! There are dedicated viewing areas with great visibility of the track, along with various food and drink stands to keep everyone refreshed. Whether you’re in the race or just watching, there’s always something exciting happening. Safety is also a top priority. If a medical team is present, they have a dedicated emergency area equipped with everything needed for urgent situations. Additionally, there is a helipad for emergency air transport, ensuring fast medical assistance when necessary. This racetrack is designed to create an exciting and realistic experience for everyone. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to share – your feedback helps make it even better. Enjoy the new racetrack at the Los Santos Harbor!
